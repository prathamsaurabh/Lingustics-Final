🧠 Lexical Clustering and Semantic Interpretation in Supreme Court Opinions

This repository contains all code, data, and generated outputs used in the computational linguistic analysis of Supreme Court cases. The goal of this study is to investigate whether word clustering reveals underlying semantic themes that facilitate interpretation of complex legal texts.

📂 Repository Contents
🔹 1. Preprocessing

Scripts for extracting and normalizing text from court documents.

🔹 2. Word Vectorization

Python files implementing Word2Vec embeddings.

🔹 3. K-Clustering Algorithm

Clustering scripts using Scikit-Learn to group vectors based on semantic proximity.

🔹 4. PCA Visualization

Tools for dimensional reduction and 2D plotting of cluster relationships.

🔹 5. Output Graphs and Results

Generated figures from PCA projections and clustering experiments.

🛠️ Technologies Used

📄 Purpose of Study

This research examines the semantic, syntactic, and phonetic implications of lexical clustering in legal discourse, with emphasis on:

Underlying conceptual domains

Semantic grouping

Morphological and syntactic patterns

Interpretation of meaning without full document reading
