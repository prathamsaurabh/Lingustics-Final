## Project Overview
This repository contains all computational scripts, data outputs, and visualization files used to analyze semantic clustering in Supreme Court opinions.

The goal of this project is to investigate whether lexical distribution reveals underlying thematic structure in legal discourse.

---

## Method Summary

### 🔹 Word Vectorization
- implemented using Word2Vec  
- similar linguistic context produces similar vectors  

### 🔹 K-Clustering
- implemented using Scikit-Learn  
- clusters vectors by semantic proximity  

### 🔹 PCA Visualization
- dimensionality reduction  
- allows interpretation of clusters in 2D form  

---

## Goals of Study
- Identify semantic domains within legal opinions  
- Analyze syntactic and morphological properties of clustered terms  
- Evaluate whether interpretive meaning can be derived without reading entire documents  

---

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Word2Vec  
- Scikit-Learn  
- PCA  

---

## Results Summary
- Clustered lexical items reflect thematic domains  
- Semantic groupings align with legal structure  
- Dense clusters correspond to specialized legal domains
