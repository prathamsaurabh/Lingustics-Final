apple.pdf,the economics of the transaction here apple argues that the app developers not apple set the retail price charged to consumers which according to apple means that the consumers may not sue apple we see three main problems with apples who sets the price theory first apples theory contradicts statutory text and precedent as we explained above the text of broadly affords injured parties a right to sue under the antitrust laws and our precedent in illinois brick established a brightline rule where direct purchasers such as the con sumers here may sue antitrust violators from whom they purchased a good or service illinois brick as we read the opinion was not based on an economic theory about who set the price rather illinois brick sought to ensure an effective and efficient litigation scheme in antitrust cases to do so the court drew a bright line that allowed direct purchasers to sue but barred indirect purchasers from suing when there is no intermediary between the pur chaser and the antitrust violator the purchaser may sue the illinois brick brightline rule is grounded on the belief that simplified administration improves antitrust enforcement a p areeda h hovenkamp r blair c durrance antitrust law e p th ed areeda hovenkamp apples theory would require us apple inc v pepper opinion of the court to rewrite the rationale of illinois brick and to gut the longstanding brightline rule to the extent that illinois brick leaves any ambiguity about whether a direct purchaser may sue an antitrust violator we should resolve that ambiguity in the direction of the statutory text and under the text direct purchas ers from monopolistic retailers are proper plaintiffs to sue those retailers second in addition to deviating from statutory text and precedent apples proposed rule is not persuasive econom ically or legally apples effort to transform illinois brick from a directpurchaser rule to a who sets the price rule would draw an arbitrary and unprincipled line among retailers based on retailers financial arrangements with their manufacturers or suppliers in the retail context the price charged by a retailer to a consumer is often a result at least in part of the price charged by the manufacturer or supplier to the retailer or of negotiations between the manufacturer or supplier and the retailer those agreements between manufacturer or supplier and retailer may take myriad forms including for example a markup,2
apple.pdf,pricing model or a commission pricing model in a traditional markup pricing model a hypothet ical monopolistic retailer might pay to the manufacturer and then sell the product for keeping for itself in a commission pricing model the retailer might pay noth ing to the manufacturer agree with the manufacturer that the retailer will sell the product for and keep per cent of the sales price and then sell the product for send back to the manufacturer and keep in those two different pricing scenarios everything turns out to be economically the same for the manufacturer retailer and consumer yet apples proposed rule would allow a consumer to sue the monopolistic retailer in the former situation but not the latter in other words under apples rule a consumer cite as u s opinion of the court could sue a monopolistic retailer when the retailer set the retail price by marking up the price it had paid the manu facturer or supplier for the good or service but a consumer could not sue a monopolistic retailer when the manufac turer or supplier set the retail price and the retailer took a commission on each sale apples linedrawing does not make a lot of sense other than as a way to gerrymander apple out of this and simi lar lawsuits in particular we fail to see why the form of the upstream arrangement between the manufacturer or supplier and the retailer should determine whether a monopolistic retailer can be sued by a downstream con sumer who has purchased a good or service directly from the retailer and has paid a higherthancompetitive price because of the retailers unlawful monopolistic conduct as the court of appeals aptly stated the distinction between a markup and a commission is immaterial f d at a leading antitrust treatise likewise states denying standing because title never passes to a broker is an overly lawyered approach that ignores the reality that a distribution system that relies on brokerage is economically indistinguishable from one that relies on purchaserresellers a areeda hovenkamp at if a retailer has engaged in unlawful monopolistic conduct that has caused consumers to pay higherthan competitive prices it does not matter how the retailer structured its relationship with an upstream manufacturer or supplierwhether for example the retailer employed a markup or kept a commission to be sure if the monopolistic retailers conduct has not caused the consumer,2
apple.pdf,to pay a higherthancompetitive price then the plaintiff s damages will be zero here for example if the competitive commission rate were per cent rather than percent but apple could prove that app developers in a percent commission system would always set a higher price such that consumers would pay apple inc v pepper opinion of the court the same retail price regardless of whether apples com mission was percent or percent then the consumers damages would presumably be zero but we cannot as sume in all casesas apple would necessarily have us dothat a monopolistic retailer who keeps a commission does not ever cause the consumer to pay a higherthan competitive price we find no persuasive legal or economic basis for such a blanket assertion in short we do not understand the relevance of the upstream market structure in deciding whether a down stream consumer may sue a monopolistic retailer apples rule would elevate form what is the precise arrangement between manufacturers or suppliers and retailers over substance is the consumer paying a higher price because of the monopolistic retailers actions if the retailers unlawful monopolistic conduct caused a consumer to pay the retailer a higherthancompetitive price the consumer is entitled to sue the retailer under the antitrust laws third if accepted apples theory would provide a roadmap for monopolistic retailers to structure transac tions with manufacturers or suppliers so as to evade anti trust claims by consumers and thereby thwart effective antitrust enforcement consider a traditional supplierretailer relationship in which the retailer purchases a product from the supplier and sells the product with a markup to consumers under apples proposed rule a retailer instead of buying the product from the supplier could arrange to sell the prod uct for the supplier without purchasing it from the sup plier in other words rather than paying the supplier a certain price for the product and then marking up the price to sell the product to consumers the retailer could collect the price of the product from consumers and remit only a fraction of that price to the supplier that restructuring would allow a monopolistic retailer to insulate itself from antitrust suits by consumers even cite as u s opinion of the court in situations where a monopolistic retailer is using its monopoly to charge higherthancompetitive prices to consumers we decline to greenlight monopolistic retail ers to exploit their market position,2
apple.pdf,in that way we refuse to rubberstamp such a blatant evasion of statutory text and judicial precedent in sum apples theory would disregard statutory text and precedent create an unprincipled and economically senseless distinction among monopolistic retailers and furnish monopolistic retailers with a howto guide for evasion of the antitrust laws c in arguing that the court should transform the direct purchaser rule into a who sets the price rule apple insists that the three reasons that the court identified in illinois brick for adopting the directpurchaser rule apply to this caseeven though the consumers here unlike in illinois brick were direct purchasers from the alleged monopolist the illinois brick court listed three reasons for barring indirectpurchaser suits facilitating more effective enforcement of antitrust laws avoiding com plicated damages calculations and eliminating dupli cative damages against antitrust defendants as we said in utilicorp however the brightline rule of illinois brick means that there is no reason to ask whether the rationales of illinois brick apply with equal force in every individual case u s at we should not engage in an unwarranted and counterproductive exer cise to litigate a series of exceptions id at but even if we engage with this argument we conclude that the three illinois brick rationaleswhether consid ered individually or togethercut strongly in the plain tiffs favor here not apples first apple argues that barring the iphone owners from suing apple will better promote effective enforcement of apple inc v pepper opinion of the court the antitrust laws apple posits that allowing only the upstream app developersand not the downstream con sumersto sue apple would mean more effective enforce ment of the antitrust laws we do not agree leaving consumers at the mercy of monopolistic retailers simply because upstream suppliers could also sue the retailers makes little sense and would directly contradict the longstanding goal of effective private enforcement and consumer protection in antitrust cases second apple warns that calculating the damages in successful consumer antitrust suits against monopolistic retailers might be complicated it is true that it may be hard to determine what the retailer would have charged in a competitive market expert testimony will often be necessary but that is hardly unusual in antitrust cases illinois brick is not a getoutofcourtfree card for monop olistic retailers to play any time that a damages calcula tion might be complicated illinois brick surely did not wipe,2

apple.pdf,that the commission was entirely illegal apple can only be required to pay out in damages at most the full amount it received in commissions to their credit even plaintiffs have conceded as much acknowledging that because there is only one markup any claim by the developers against apple would necessarily be seeking a piece of the same pie brief in opposition its a mystery why the court refuses to accept that sensible concession apple inc v pepper gorsuch j dissenting iii the united states and its antitrust regulators agree with all of this so how does the court reach such a differ ent conclusion seizing on illinois bricks use of the shorthand phrase direct purchasers to describe the parties immediately injured by the monopoly overcharge in that case the court recharacterizes illinois brick as a rule that anyone who purchases goods directly from an alleged antitrust violator can sue while anyone who doesnt cant under this revisionist version of illinois brick the dispositive question becomes whether an in termediary in the distribution chain stands between the plaintiff and the defendant ante at and because the plaintiff app purchasers in this case happen to have pur chased apps directly from apple the court reasons they may sue this exalts form over substance instead of focusing on the traditional proximate cause question where the al leged overcharge is first and thus surely felt the courts test turns on who happens to be in privity of contract with whom but weve long recognized that antitrust law should look at the economic reality of the relevant trans actions rather than formal conceptions of contract law united states v concentrated phosphate export assn inc u s and this case illustrates why to evade the courts test all apple must do is amend its contracts instead of collecting payments for apps sold in the app store and remitting the balance less its commission to developers apple can simply specify that consumers payments will flow the other way directly to the developers who will then remit commissions to apple no antitrust reason exists to treat these contrac tual arrangements differently and doing so will only induce firms to abandon their preferredand presumably more efficientdistribution arrangements in favor of less efficient ones all so they might avoid an arbitrary legal cite as u s gorsuch j dissenting rule see copperweld corp v independence tube corp u s,2
apple.pdf,rejecting an artificial distinction that serves no valid antitrust goals but merely deprives consumers and producers of the benefits of a particular business model nor does illinois brick come close to endorsing such a blind formalism yes as the court notes the plaintiff in illinois brick did contract directly with an intermediary rather than with the putative antitrust violator but illinois bricks rejection of passon claims and its explana tion of the difficulties those claims present had nothing to do with privity of contract instead and as we have seen its rule and reasoning grew from the general tendency of the law not to go beyond the party that first felt the sting of the alleged overcharge and from the complica tions that can arise when courts attempt to discern whether and to what degree damages were passed on to others supra at the court today risks replacing a cogent rule about proximate cause with a pointless and easily evaded imposter we do not usually read our own precedents so uncharitably maybe the court proceeds as it does today because it just disagrees with illinois brick after all the court not only displaces a sensible rule in favor of a senseless one it also proceeds to question each of illinois bricks ration alesdoubting that those directly injured are always the best plaintiffs to bring suit that calculating damages for passon plaintiffs will often be unduly complicated and that conflicting claims to a common fund justify limiting who may sue ante at the court even tells us that any ambiguity about the permissibility of passon damages should be resolved in the direction of the statu tory text ante at ignoring that illinois brick followed the welltrodden path of construing the statutory text in light of background common law principles of proximate cause last but not least the court suggests that the apple inc v pepper gorsuch j dissenting traditional understanding of illinois brick leads to arbi trary and unprincipled results ante at it asks us to consider two hypothetical scenarios that it says prove the point the first is a markup scenario in which a monopo listic retailer buys a product from a manufacturer for and then decides to sell the product to a consumer for applying a supracompetitive markup the second is a commission scenario in which a manufacturer directs a monopolistic retailer to sell the manufacturers product to a,2
apple.pdf,consumer for and the retailer keeps a supracompeti tive commission sending back to the manufac turer the two scenarios are economically the same the court asserts and forbidding recovery in the second for lack of proximate cause makes no sense but there is nothing arbitrary or unprincipled about illinois bricks rule or results the notion that the causal chain must stop somewhere is an ancient and venerable one as with most any rule of proximate cause reasonable people can debate whether illinois brick drew exactly the right line in cutting off claims where it did but the line it drew is intelligible principled administrable and far more reasonable than the courts artificial rule of contrac tual privity nor do the courts hypotheticals come close to proving otherwise in the first scenario the markup falls initially on the consumer so theres no doubt that the retailers anticompetitive conduct proximately caused the consumers injury meanwhile in the second scenario the commission falls initially on the manufacturer and the consumer wont feel the pain unless the manufacturer can and does recoup some or all of the elevated commission by raising its own prices in that situation the manufacturer is the directly injured party and the difficulty of disaggre gating damages between those directly and indirectly harmed means that the consumer cant establish proxi mate cause under traditional principles some amici share the courts skepticism of illinois cite as u s gorsuch j dissenting brick they even urge us to overrule illinois brick assur ing us that modern economic techniques can now miti gate any problems that arise in allocating damages be tween those who suffer them directly and those who suffer them indirectly brief for state of texas et al as amici curiae maybe there is something to these arguments maybe not but theres plenty of reason to decline any invitation to take even a small step away from illinois brick today the plaintiffs have not asked us to overrule our precedentin fact theyve disavowed any such re quest tr of oral arg so we lack the benefit of the adversarial process in a complex area involving a year old precedent and many hard questions for example if we are really inclined to overrule illinois brick doesnt that mean we must do the same to hanover shoe if the proximate cause line is no longer to be drawn at the first injured party,2

miranda.pdf,attempt to prove these elements mr justice harlan whom mr justice stewart and mr justice white join dissenting i believe the decision of the court represents poor constitutional law and entails harmful consequences for the country at large how serious these consequences may prove to be only time can tell but the basic flaws in the courts justification seem to me readily apparent now once all sides of the problem are considered i introduction at tite outset it is well to note exactly what is re quired by the courts new constitutional code of rules for confessions the foremost requirement upon which later admissibility of a confession depends is that a four fold warning be given to a person in custody before he is questioned namely that he has a right to remain silent that anything he says may be used against him that he has a right to have present an attorney during the questioningi and that if indigent he has a right to a lawyer without charge to forgo these rights some affirmative statement of rejection is seemingly required and threats tricks or cajolings to obtain this waiver are forbidden if before or during questioning the suspect seeks to invoke his right to remain silent interroga tion must be frgone or cease a request for counsel miranda v arizona harlan j dissenting brings about the same result until a lawyer is procured finally there are a miscelany of minor directives for example the burden of proof of waiver is on the state admissions and exculpatory statements are treated just like confessions withdrawal of a waiver is always permitted and so forth while the fine points of this scheme are far less clear than the court admits the tenor is quite apparent the new rules are not designed to guard against police bru tality or other unmistakably banned forms of coercion those who use thirddegree tactics and deny them in court are equally able and destined tb lie as skillfully about warnings and waivers rather the thrust of the new rules is to negate all pressures to reinforce the nerv ous or ignorant suspect and ultimately to discourage any confession at all the aim in short is toward volun tariness in a utopian sense or to view it from a different angle voluntariness with a vengeance to incorporate this notion into the constitution re quires a strained reading of,1
miranda.pdf,history and precedent and a disregard of the very pragmatic concerns that alone may on occasion justify such strains i believe that reasoned examination will show that the due process clauses pro vide an adequate tool for coping with confessions and that even if the fifth amendment privilege against self incrimination be invoked its precedents taken as a whole do not sustain the present rules viewed as a choice based on pure policy these new rules prove to be a highly debatable if not onesided appraisal of the competing interests imposed over widespread objection at the very time when judicial restraint is most called for by the circumstances my discussion in this opinion is directed to the main questions decided by the court and necessary to its decision in ignoring some of the collateral points i do not mean to imply agreement october term hanlan j dissenting u s ii constitutional premises it is most fitting to begin an inquiry into the constitu tional precedents by surveying the limits on confessions the court has evolved under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment this is so because these cases show that there exists a workable and effective means of dealing with confessionsin a judicial manner because the cases are the baseline from which the court now departs and so serve to measure the actual as opposed to the professed distance it travels and because examination of them hel reveal how the court has coasted into its present position the earliest confession cases in this court emerged from federal prosecutions and were settled on a noncon stitutional basis the court adopting the commonlaw rule that the absence of inducements promises and threats made a confession voluntary and admissible hopt v utah u s pierce v united states u s while a later case said the fifth amend ment privilege controlled admissibility this proposition was not itself developed in subsequent decisions the court did however heighten the test of admissibility in federal trials to one of voluntariness in fact wan v the case was brain v united states u s quoted ante p its historical premises were afterwards disproved by wigmore who concluded that no assertions could be more un founded wigmore evidence at n d ed the court in united states v carignan u s declined to choose between bram and wigmore and stein v new york u s n,1

miranda.pdf,of more recent decisions of state appellate tribunals or this court but even if the relentless application of the described procedures could lead to involuntary confessions it most assuredly does not follow that each and every case will disclose this kind of interrogation or this kind of consequence insofar as appears from the courts opinion it has not examined a single transcript of any police interrogation let alone the interrogation that took place in any one of these cases which it decides today judged by any of the standards for empirical investigation utilized in the social sciences the factual basis for the courts premise is patently inadequate although in the courts view incustody interrogation is inherently coercive the court says that the sponta neous product of the coercion of arrest and detention is still to be deemed voluntary an accused arrested on probable cause may blurt out a confession which will be admissible despite the fact that he is alone and in cus tody without any showing that he had any notion of his right to remain silent or of the consequences of his ad mission yet under the courts rule if the police ask him a single question such as do you have anything to say or did you kill your wife his response if there is one has somehow been compelled even if the accused has in fact the type of sustained interrogation described by the court appears to be the exception rather than the rule a survey of cases in one city found that in almost half of the cases the interrogation lasted less than minutes barrett police practices and the lawfrom arrest to release or charge calif l rev questioning tends to be confused and sporadic and is usually concentrated on confrontations with witnesses or new items of evidence as these are obtained by officers conducting the investigation see generally lafave arrest the decision to take a suspect into custody ali a model code of pre arraignment procedure commentary at n tent draft no october term white j dissenting u s been clearly warned of his right to remain silent com mon sense informs us to the contrary while one may say that the response was involuntary in the sense the question provoked or was the occasion for the response and thus the defendant was induced to speak out when he might have remained silent if,1
